Scanner is a class available in java.util package which is used to take input from a user or input from a file.

Steps to take user input:
      1-> We have to import Scanner class of util package by using import keyword:
                        import java.util.Scanner;
          the import statement must be the first statement of the file.
      2-> We have to create object of Scanner class to call non-static methods of Scanner class
                        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      3-> We have to call different methods of Scanner class to accept different types of data
                        -> byte = nextByte();
                        -> short = nextShort();
                        -> int = nextInt();
                        -> float = nextFloat();
                        -> long = nextLong();
                        -> dounle = nextDouble();
                        -> boolean = nextBoolean();
                        -> String (only first word) = next();
                        -> String (Complete sentance) = nextLine();
                        -> char = next().charAt(index)
