1> Local variable: If a variable is not directly declared inside class block then it is call a local variable.
In another word if a variable is inside method block, constructor block or a block after class block then it is called a local variable.

e.g. public static void main (String[] agrs) {
    int x = 30;
    int y = 40;
}
